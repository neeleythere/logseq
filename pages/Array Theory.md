	- ## Subarray  #card
		- A subarray is a sequence of values which follow the same order and data type (contiguous).
		- Given: `[2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4]`, `[3, 6, 1]` is a subarray. While `[3, 1, 5]` is not.
	- ## Subsequence #card
		- A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived without reordering elements, other than deleting existing elements.
		- Given: `[2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4]`, `[3, 1, 5]` is a subsequence. While `[3, 1, 6]` is not.
